In fact, the terminology of AI risk recently changed from \u201cAI safety\u201d \u2013 the term used by people who are worried that AI would literally kill us \u2013 to \u201cAI alignment\u201d \u2013 the term used by people who are worried about societal \u201charms\u201d. The original AI safety people are frustrated by this shift, although they don\u2019t know how to put it back in the box \u2013 they now advocate that the actual AI risk topic be renamed \u201cAI notkilleveryoneism\u201d, which has not yet been widely adopted but is at least clear.\n\nThe tipoff to the nature of the AI societal risk claim is its own term, \u201cAI alignment\u201d. Alignment with what? Human values. Whose human values? Ah, that\u2019s where things get tricky.\n\nAs it happens, I have had a front row seat to an analogous situation \u2013 the social media \u201ctrust and safety\u201d wars. As is now obvious, social media services have been under massive pressure from governments and activists to ban, restrict, censor, and otherwise suppress a wide range of content for many years. And the same concerns of \u201chate speech\u201d (and its mathematical counterpart, \u201calgorithmic bias\u201d) and \u201cmisinformation\u201d are being directly transferred from the social media context to the new frontier of \u201cAI alignment\u201d.\n\nMy big learnings from the social media wars are:\n\nOn the one hand, there is no absolutist free speech position. First, every country, including the United States, makes at least some content illegal. Second, there are certain kinds of content, like child pornography and incitements to real world violence, that are nearly universally agreed to be off limits \u2013 legal or not \u2013 by virtually every society. So any technological platform that facilitates or generates content \u2013 speech \u2013 is going to have some restrictions.\n\nOn the other hand, the slippery slope is not a fallacy, it\u2019s an inevitability. Once a framework for restricting even egregiously terrible content is in place \u2013 for example, for hate speech, a specific hurtful word, or for misinformation, obviously false claims like \u201cthe Pope is dead\u201d \u2013 a shockingly broad range of government agencies and activist pressure groups and nongovernmental entities will kick into gear and demand ever greater levels of censorship and suppression of content.",

This cult has pulled in not just fringe characters, but also some actual industry experts and a not small number of wealthy donors \u2013 including, until recently, Sam Bankman-Fried. And it\u2019s developed a full panoply of cult behaviors and beliefs.\n\nThis cult is why there are a set of AI risk doomers who sound so extreme \u2013 it\u2019s not that they actually have secret knowledge that make their extremism logical, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve whipped themselves into a frenzy and really are...extremely extreme.\n\nIt turns out that this type of cult isn\u2019t new \u2013 there is a longstanding Western tradition of millenarianism, which generates apocalypse cults. The AI risk cult has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult. From Wikipedia, with additions by me:\n\n---\n\n\u201cMillenarianism is the belief by a group or movement [AI risk doomers] in a coming fundamental transformation of society [the arrival of AI], after which all things will be changed [AI utopia, dystopia, and/or end of the world]. Only dramatic events [AI bans, airstrikes on datacenters, nuclear strikes on unregulated AI] are seen as able to change the world [prevent AI] and the change is anticipated to be brought about, or survived, by a group of the devout and dedicated. In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come [AI apocalypse, or its prevention] will be followed by a new, purified world [AI bans] in which the believers will be rewarded [or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along].\u201d\n\n---\n\nThis apocalypse cult pattern is so obvious that I am surprised more people don\u2019t see it.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, cults are fun to hear about, their written material is often creative and fascinating, and their members are engaging at dinner parties and on TV. But their extreme beliefs should not determine the future of laws and society \u2013 obviously not.\n\n[Source URL: https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/]",

    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_16.png": "The Actual Risk Of Not Pursuing AI With Maximum Force And Speed\n\nThere is one final, and real, AI risk that is probably the scariest at all:\n\nAI isn\u2019t just being developed in the relatively free societies of the West, it is also being developed by the Communist Party of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nChina has a vastly different vision for AI than we do \u2013 they view it as a mechanism for authoritarian population control, full stop. They are not even being secretive about this, they are very clear about it, and they are already pursuing their agenda. And they do not intend to limit their AI strategy to China \u2013 they intend to proliferate it all across the world, everywhere they are powering 5G networks, everywhere they are loaning Belt And Road money, everywhere they are providing friendly consumer apps like Tiktok that serve as front ends to their centralized command and control AI.\n\nThe single greatest risk of AI is that China wins global AI dominance and we \u2013 the United States and the West \u2013 do not.\n\nI propose a simple strategy for what to do about this \u2013 in fact, the same strategy President Ronald Reagan used to win the first Cold War with the Soviet Union. \n\n\u201cWe win, they lose.\u201d\n\nRather than allowing ungrounded panics around killer AI, \u201charmful\u201d AI, job-destroying AI, and inequality-generating AI to put us on our back feet, we in the United States and the West should lean into AI as hard as we possibly can.\n\nWe should seek to win the race to global AI technological superiority and ensure that China does not.\n\nIn the process, we should drive AI into our economy and society as fast and hard as we possibly can, in order to maximize its gains for economic productivity and human potential.\n\nThis is the best way both to offset the real AI risks and to ensure that our way of life is not displaced by the much darker Chinese vision.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_6.png": "AI Risk #1: Will AI Kill Us All?\n\nThe first and original AI doomer risk is that AI will decide to literally kill humanity.\n\nThe fear that technology of our own creation will rise up and destroy us is deeply coded into our culture. The Greeks expressed this fear in the Prometheus Myth \u2013 Prometheus brought the destructive power of fire, and more generally technology (\"techne\"), to man, for which Prometheus was condemned to perpetual torture by the gods. Later, Mary Shelley gave us moderns our own version of this myth in her novel Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus, in which we develop the technology for eternal life, which then rises up and seeks to destroy us. And of course, no AI panic newspaper story is complete without a still image of a gleaming red-eyed killer robot from James Cameron\u2019s Terminator films.\n\nThe presumed evolutionary purpose of this mythology is to motivate us to seriously consider potential risks of new technologies \u2013 fire, after all, can indeed be used to burn down entire cities. But just as fire was also the foundation of modern civilization as used to keep us warm and safe in a cold and hostile world, this mythology ignores the far greater upside of most \u2013 all? \u2013 new technologies, and in practice inflames destructive emotion rather than reasoned analysis. Just because premodern man freaked out like this doesn\u2019t mean we have to; we can apply rationality instead.\n\nMy view is that the idea that AI will decide to literally kill humanity is a profound category error. AI is not a living being that has been primed by billions of years of evolution to participate in the battle for the survival of the fittest, as animals are, and as we are. It is math \u2013 code \u2013 computers, built by people, owned by people, used by people, controlled by people. The idea that it will at some point develop a mind of its own and decide that it has motivations that lead it to try to kill us is a superstitious handwave.\n\nIn short, AI doesn\u2019t want, it doesn\u2019t have goals, it doesn\u2019t want to kill you, because it\u2019s not alive. And AI is a machine \u2013 is not going to come alive any more than your toaster will.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_7.png": "Now, obviously, there are true believers in killer AI \u2013 Baptists \u2013 who are gaining a suddenly strategic amount of media coverage for their terrifying warnings, some of whom claim to have been studying the topic for decades and say they are now scared out of their minds by what they have learned. Some of these true believers are even actual innovators of the technology. These actors are arguing for a variety of bizarre and extreme restrictions on AI ranging from a ban on AI development, all the way up to military airstrikes on datacenters and nuclear war. They argue that because people like me cannot rule out future catastrophic consequences of AI, that we must assume a precautionary stance that may require large amounts of physical violence and death in order to prevent potential existential risk.\n\nMy response is that their position is non-scientific \u2013 What is the testable hypothesis? What would falsify the hypothesis? How do we know when we are getting into a danger zone? These questions go mainly unanswered apart from \u201cYou can\u2019t prove it won\u2019t happen!\u201d In fact, these Baptists\u2019 position is so non-scientific and so extreme \u2013 a conspiracy theory about math and code \u2013 and is already calling for physical violence, that I will do something I would normally not do and question their motives as well.\n\nSpecifically, I think three things are going on:\n\nFirst, recall that John Von Neumann responded to Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s famous hand-wringing about his role creating nuclear weapons \u2013 which helped end World War II and prevent World War III \u2013 with, \u201cSome people confess guilt to claim credit for the sin.\u201d What is the most dramatic way one can claim credit for the importance of one\u2019s work without sounding overly boastful? This explains the mismatch between the words and actions of the Baptists who are actually building and funding AI \u2013 watch their actions, not their words. (Truman was harsher after meeting with Oppenheimer: \u201cDon\u2019t let that crybaby in here again.\u201d)\n\nSecond, some of the Baptists are actually Bootleggers. There is a whole profession of \u201cAI safety expert\u201d, \u201cAI ethicist\u201d, \u201cAI risk researcher\u201d. They are paid to be doomers, and their statements should be processed appropriately.\n\nThird, California is justifiably famous for our many thousands of cults, from EST to the Peoples Temple, from Heaven\u2019s Gate to the Manson Family. Many, although not all, of these cults are harmless, and maybe even serve a purpose for alienated people who find homes in them. But some are very dangerous indeed, and cults have a notoriously hard time straddling the line that ultimately leads to violence and death.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_17.png": "What Is To Be Done?\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI propose a simple plan:\n\nBig AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can \u2013 but not allowed to achieve regulatory capture, not allowed to establish a government-protected cartel that is insulated from market competition due to incorrect claims of AI risk. This will maximize the technological and societal payoff from the amazing capabilities of these companies, which are jewels of modern capitalism.\n\nStartup AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can. They should neither confront government-granted protection of big companies, nor should they receive government assistance. They should simply be allowed to compete. If and as startups don\u2019t succeed, their presence in the market will also continuously motivate big companies to be their best \u2013 our economies and societies win either way.\n\nOpen source AI should be allowed to freely proliferate and compete with both big AI companies and startups. There should be no regulatory barriers to open source whatsoever. Even when open source does not beat companies, its widespread availability is a boon to students all over the world who want to learn how to build and use AI to become part of the technological future, and will ensure that AI is available to everyone who can benefit from it no matter who they are or how much money they have.\n\nTo offset the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI, governments working in partnership with the private sector should vigorously engage in each area of potential risk to use AI to maximize society\u2019s defensive capabilities. This shouldn\u2019t be limited to AI-enabled risks but also more general problems such as malnutrition, disease, and climate. AI can be an incredibly powerful tool for solving problems, and we should embrace it as such.\n\nTo prevent the risk of China achieving global AI dominance, we should use the full power of our private sector, our scientific establishment, and our governments in concert to drive American and Western AI to absolute global dominance, including ultimately inside China itself. We win, they lose.\n\nAnd that is how we use AI to save the world.\n\nIt\u2019s time to build.\n\nLegends and Heroes\nI close with two simple statements.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_15.png": "The AI cat is obviously already out of the bag. You can learn how to build AI from thousands of free online courses, books, papers, and videos, and there are outstanding open source implementations proliferating by the day. AI is like air \u2013 it will be everywhere. The level of totalitarian oppression that would be required to arrest that would be so draconian \u2013 a world government monitoring and controlling all computers? jackbooted thugs in black helicopters seizing rogue GPUs? \u2013 that we would not have a society left to protect.\n\nSo instead, there are two very straightforward ways to address the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI, and these are precisely what we should focus on.\n\nFirst, we have laws on the books to criminalize most of the bad things that anyone is going to do with AI. Hack into the Pentagon? That\u2019s a crime. Steal money from a bank? That\u2019s a crime. Create a bioweapon? That\u2019s a crime. Commit a terrorist act? That\u2019s a crime. We can simply focus on preventing those crimes when we can, and prosecuting them when we cannot. We don\u2019t even need new laws \u2013 I\u2019m not aware of a single actual bad use for AI that\u2019s been proposed that\u2019s not already illegal. And if a new bad use is identified, we ban that use. QED.\n\nBut you\u2019ll notice what I slipped in there \u2013 I said we should focus first on preventing AI-assisted crimes before they happen \u2013 wouldn\u2019t such prevention mean banning AI? Well, there\u2019s another way to prevent such actions, and that\u2019s by using AI as a defensive tool. The same capabilities that make AI dangerous in the hands of bad guys with bad goals make it powerful in the hands of good guys with good goals \u2013 specifically the good guys whose job it is to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nFor example, if you are worried about AI generating fake people and fake videos, the answer is to build new systems where people can verify themselves and real content via cryptographic signatures. Digital creation and alteration of both real and fake content was already here before AI; the answer is not to ban word processors and Photoshop \u2013 or AI \u2013 but to use technology to build a system that actually solves the problem.\n\nAnd so, second, let\u2019s mount major efforts to use AI for good, legitimate, defensive purposes. Let\u2019s put AI to work in cyberdefense, in biological defense, in hunting terrorists, and in everything else that we do to keep ourselves, our communities, and our nation safe.\n\nThere are already many smart people in and out of government doing exactly this, of course \u2013 but if we apply all of the effort and brainpower that\u2019s currently fixated on the futile prospect of banning AI to using AI to protect against bad people doing bad things, I think there\u2019s no question a world infused with AI will be much safer than the world we live in today.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_5.png": "BAPTISTS\n\"Baptists\" are the true believer social reformers who legitimately feel \u2013 deeply and emotionally, if not rationally \u2013 that new restrictions, regulations, and laws are required to prevent societal disaster. For alcohol prohibition, these actors were often literally devout Christians who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society. For AI risk, these actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks \u2013 strap them to a polygraph, they really mean it.\n\nBOOTLEGGERS\n\"Bootleggers\" are the self-interested opportunists who stand to financially profit by the imposition of new restrictions, regulations, and laws that insulate them from competitors. For alcohol prohibition, these were the literal bootleggers who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned. For AI risk, these are CEOs who stand to make more money if regulatory barriers are erected that form a cartel of government-blessed AI vendors protected from new startup and open source competition \u2013 the software version of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks.\n\nA cynic would suggest that some of the apparent Baptists are also Bootleggers \u2013 specifically the ones paid to attack AI by their universities, think tanks, activist groups, and media outlets. If you are paid a salary or receive grants to foster AI panic\u2026you are probably a Bootlegger.\n\nThe problem with the Bootleggers is that they win. The Baptists are naive ideologues, the Bootleggers are cynical operators, and so the result of reform movements like these is often that the Bootleggers get what they want \u2013 regulatory capture, insulation from competition, the formation of a cartel \u2013 and the Baptists are left wondering where their drive for social improvement went so wrong.\n\nWe just lived through a stunning example of this \u2013 banking reform after the 2008 global financial crisis. The Baptists told us that we needed new laws and regulations to break up the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again. So Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was marketed as satisfying the Baptists' goal, but in reality was coopted by the Bootleggers \u2013 the big banks. The result is that the same banks that were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d in 2008 are much, much larger now.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_4.png": "So Why The Panic?\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIn contrast to this positive view, the public conversation about AI is presently shot through with hysterical fear and paranoia.\n\nWe hear claims that AI will variously kill us all, ruin our society, take all our jobs, cause crippling inequality, and enable bad people to do awful things.\n\nWhat explains this divergence in potential outcomes from near utopia to horrifying dystopia?\n\nHistorically, every new technology that matters, from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the Internet, has sparked a moral panic \u2013 a social contagion that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world, or society, or both. The fine folks at Pessimists Archive have documented these technology-driven moral panics over the decades; their history makes the pattern vividly clear. It turns out this present panic is not even the first for AI.\n\nNow, it is certainly the case that many new technologies have led to bad outcomes \u2013 often the same technologies that have been otherwise enormously beneficial to our welfare. So it\u2019s not that the mere existence of a moral panic means there is nothing to be concerned about.\n\nBut a moral panic is by its very nature irrational \u2013 it takes what may be a legitimate concern and inflates it into a level of hysteria that ironically makes it harder to confront actually serious concerns.\n\nAnd wow do we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now.\n\nThis moral panic is already being used as a motivating force by a variety of actors to demand policy action \u2013 new AI restrictions, regulations, and laws. These actors, who are making extremely dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI \u2013 feeding on and further inflaming moral panic \u2013 all present themselves as selfless champions of the public good.\n\nBut are they?\n\nAnd are they right or wrong?\n\nThe Baptists And Bootleggers Of AI\n\nEconomists have observed a longstanding pattern in reform movements of this kind. The actors within movements like these fall into two categories \u2013 \u201cBaptists\u201d and \u201cBootleggers\u201d \u2013 drawing on the historical example of the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920\u2019s.\n",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_14.png": "In short, everyone gets the thing \u2013 as we saw in the past with not just cars but also electricity, radio, computers, the Internet, mobile phones, and search engines. The makers of such technologies are highly motivated to drive down their prices until everyone on the planet can afford them. This is precisely what is already happening in AI \u2013 it's why you can use state of the art generative AI not just at low cost but even for free today in the form of Microsoft Bing and Google Bard \u2013 and it is what will continue to happen. Not because such vendors are foolish or generous but precisely because they are greedy \u2013 they want to maximize the size of their market, which maximizes their profits.\n\nSo what happens is the opposite of technology driving centralization of wealth \u2013 individual customers of the technology, ultimately including everyone on the planet, are empowered instead, and capture most of the generated value. As with prior technologies, the companies that build AI \u2013 assuming they have to function in a free market \u2013 will compete furiously to make this happen.\n\nMarx was wrong then, and he\u2019s wrong now.\n\nThis is not to say that inequality is not an issue in our society. It is, it's just not being driven by technology, it's being driven by the reverse, by the sectors of the economy that are the most resistant to new technology, that have the most government intervention to prevent the adoption of new technology like AI \u2013 specifically housing, education, and health care. The actual risk of AI and inequality is not that AI will cause more inequality but rather that we will not allow AI to be used to reduce inequality.\n\nAI Risk #5: Will AI Lead to Bad People Doing Bad Things?\n\nSo far I have explained why four of the five most often proposed risks of AI are not actually real \u2013 AI will not come to life and kill us, AI will not ruin our society, AI will not cause mass unemployment, and AI will not cause an ruinous increase in inequality. But now let\u2019s address the fifth, the one I actually agree with: AI will make it easier for bad people to do bad things.\n\nIn some sense this is a tautology. Technology is a tool. Tools, starting with fire and rocks, can be used to do good things \u2013 cook food and build houses \u2013 and bad things \u2013 burn people and bludgeon people. Any technology can be used for good or bad. Fair enough. And AI will make it easier for criminals, terrorists, and hostile governments to do bad things, no question.\n\nThis causes some people to propose, well, in that case, let\u2019s not take the risk, let\u2019s ban AI now before this can happen. Unfortunately, AI is not some esoteric physical material that is hard to come by, like plutonium. It\u2019s the opposite, it\u2019s the easiest material in the world to come by \u2013 math and code.",

AI is highly likely to be the control layer for everything in the world. How it is allowed to operate is going to matter perhaps more than anything else has ever mattered. You should be aware of how a small and isolated coterie of partisan social engineers are trying to determine that right now, under cover of the age-old claim that they are protecting you.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t let the thought police suppress AI.\n\nAI Risk #3: Will AI Take All Our Jobs?\n\nThe fear of job loss due variously to mechanization, automation, computerization, or AI has been recurring panic for hundreds of years, since the original onset of machinery such as the mechanical loom. Even though every new major technology has led to more jobs at higher wages throughout history, each wave of this panic is accompanied by claims that \u201cthis time is different\u201d \u2013 this is the time it will finally happen, this is the technology that will finally deliver the hammer blow to human labor.

AI is a computer program like any other \u2013 it runs, takes input, processes, and generates output. AI\u2019s output is useful across a wide range of fields, ranging from coding to medicine to law to the creative arts. It is owned by people and controlled by people, like any other technology.\n\nA shorter description of what AI isn\u2019t: Killer software and robots that will spring to life and decide to murder the human race or otherwise ruin everything, like you see in the movies.\n\nAn even shorter description of what AI could be: A way to make everything we care about better.\n\n[Link: https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/]",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_11.png": "We\u2019ve been through two such technology-driven unemployment panic cycles in our recent past \u2013 the outsourcing panic of the 2000's, and the automation panic of the 2010's. Notwithstanding many talking heads, pundits, and even tech industry executives pounding the table throughout both decades that mass unemployment was near, by late 2019 \u2013 right before the onset of COVID \u2013 the world had more jobs at higher wages than ever in history.\n\nNevertheless this mistaken idea will not die.\n\nAnd sure enough, it\u2019s back.\n\nThis time, we finally have the technology that\u2019s going to take all the jobs and render human workers superfluous \u2013 real AI. Surely this time history won\u2019t repeat, and AI will cause mass unemployment \u2013 and not rapid economic, job, and wage growth \u2013 right?\n\nNo, that\u2019s not going to happen \u2013 and in fact AI, if allowed to develop and proliferate throughout the economy, may cause the most dramatic and sustained economic boom of all time, with correspondingly record job and wage growth \u2013 the exact opposite of the fear. And here\u2019s why.\n\nThe core mistake the automation-kills-jobs doomer keep making is called the Lump Of Labor Fallacy. This fallacy is the incorrect notion that there is a fixed amount of labor to be done in the economy at any given time, and either machines do it or people do it \u2013 and if machines do it, there will be no work for people to do.\n\nThe Lump Of Labor Fallacy flows naturally from naive intuition, but naive intuition here is wrong. When technology is applied to production, we get productivity growth \u2013 an increase in output generated by a reduction in inputs. The result is lower prices for goods and services. As prices for goods and services fall, we pay less for them, meaning that we now have extra spending power with which to buy other things. This increases demand in the economy, which drives the creation of new production \u2013 including new products and new industries \u2013 which then creates new jobs for the people who were replaced by machines in prior jobs. The result is a larger economy with higher material prosperity, more industries, more products, and more jobs.\n\nBut the good news doesn\u2019t stop there. We also get higher wages. This is because, at the level of the individual worker, the marketplace sets compensation as a function of the marginal productivity of the worker. A worker in a technology-infused business will be more productive than a worker in a traditional business. The employer will either pay that worker more money as he is now more",

Won\u2019t that result in massive and crippling wealth inequality, as the owners of AI reap all the economic rewards and regular people get nothing?\n\nAs it happens, this was a central claim of Marxism, that the owners of the means of production \u2013 the bourgeoisie \u2013 would inevitably steal all societal wealth from the people who do the actual work \u2013 the proletariat. This is another fallacy that simply will not die no matter how often it's disproved by reality. But let's drive a stake through its heart anyway.\n\nThe flaw in this theory is that, as the owner of a piece of technology, it's not in your own interest to keep it to yourself \u2013 in fact the opposite, it's in your own interest to sell it to as many customers as possible. The largest market in the world for any product is the entire world, all 8 billion of us. And so in reality, every new technology \u2013 even ones that start by selling to the rarefied air of high-paying big companies or wealthy consumers \u2013 rapidly proliferates until it's in the hands of the largest possible mass market, ultimately everyone on the planet.\n\nThe classic example of this was Elon Musk\u2019s so-called \u201csecret plan\u201d \u2013 which he naturally published openly \u2013 for Tesla in 2006:\n\nStep 1, Build [expensive] sports car\n\nStep 2, Use that money to build an affordable car\n\nStep 3, Use that money to build an even more affordable car\n\n...which is of course exactly what he\u2019s done, becoming the richest man in the world as a result.\n\nThat last point is key. Would Elon be even richer if he only sold cars to rich people today? No. Would he be even richer than that if he only made cars for himself? Of course not. No, he maximizes his own profit by selling to the largest possible market, the world.",

Every war is characterized by terrible decisions made under intense pressure and with sharply limited information by very limited human leaders. Now, military commanders and political leaders will have AI advisors that will help them make much better strategic and tactical decisions, minimizing risk, error, and unnecessary bloodshed.\n\nIn short, anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI, and we will be able to take on new challenges that have been impossible to tackle without AI, from curing all diseases to achieving interstellar travel.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just about intelligence! Perhaps the most underestimated quality of AI is how humanizing it can be. AI art gives people who otherwise lack technical skills the freedom to create and share their artistic ideas. Talking to an empathetic AI friend really does improve their ability to handle adversity. And AI medical chatbots are already more empathetic than their human counterparts. Rather than making the world harsher and more mechanistic, infinitely patient and sympathetic AI will make the world warmer and nicer.\n\nThe stakes here are high. The opportunities are profound. AI is quite possibly the most important \u2013 and best \u2013 thing our civilization has ever created, certainly on par with electricity and microchips, and probably beyond those.\n\nThe development and proliferation of AI \u2013 far from a risk that we should fear \u2013 is a moral obligation that we have to ourselves, to our children, and to our future.\n\nWe should be living in a much better world with AI, and now we can.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_2.png": "Why AI Can Make Everything We Care About Better\n\nThe most validated core conclusion of social science across many decades and thousands of studies is that human intelligence makes a very broad range of life outcomes better. Smarter people have better outcomes in almost every domain of activity: academic achievement, job performance, occupational status, income, creativity, physical health, longevity, learning new skills, managing complex tasks, leadership, entrepreneurial success, conflict resolution, reading comprehension, financial decision making, understanding others\u2019 perspectives, creative arts, parenting outcomes, and life satisfaction.\n\nFurther, human intelligence is the lever that we have used for millennia to create the world we live in today: science, technology, math, physics, chemistry, medicine, energy, construction, transportation, communication, art, music, culture, philosophy, ethics, morality. Without the application of intelligence on all these domains, we would all still be living in mud huts, scratching out a meager existence on subsistence farming. Instead we have used our intelligence to raise our standard of living on the order of 10,000X over the last 4,000 years.\n\nWhat AI offers us is the opportunity to profoundly augment human intelligence to make all of those outcomes of intelligence \u2013 and many others, from the creation of new medicines to ways to solve climate change to technologies to reach the stars \u2013 much, much better from here.\n\nAI augmentation of human intelligence has already started \u2013 AI is already around us in the form of computer control systems of many kinds, is now rapidly escalating with AI Large Language Models like ChatGPT, and will accelerate very quickly from here \u2013 if we let it.\n\nIn our new era of AI:\n\n- Every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful. The AI tutor will be by each child\u2019s side every step of their development, helping them maximize their potential with the machine version of infinite love.\n- Every person will have an AI assistant/coach/mentor/trainer/advisor/therapist that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, and infinitely helpful. The AI assistant will be present through all of life\u2019s opportunities and challenges, maximizing every person\u2019s outcomes.\n- Every scientist will have an AI assistant/collaborator/partner that will greatly expand their scope of scientific research and achievement. Every artist, every engineer, every businessperson, every doctor, every caregiver will have the same in their worlds.\n\n[URL redacted for privacy]",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_12.png": "productive, or another employer will, purely out of self interest. The result is that technology introduced into an industry generally not only increases the number of jobs in the industry but also raises wages.\n\nTo summarize, technology empowers people to be more productive. This causes the prices for existing goods and services to fall, and for wages to rise. This in turn causes economic growth and job growth, while motivating the creation of new jobs and new industries. If a market economy is allowed to function normally and if technology is allowed to be introduced freely, this is a perpetual upward cycle that never ends. For, as Milton Friedman observed, \u201cHuman wants and needs are endless\u201d \u2013 we always want more than we have. A technology-infused market economy is the way we get closer to delivering everything everyone could conceivably want, but never all the way there. And that is why technology doesn\u2019t destroy jobs and never will.\n\nThese are such mindblowing ideas for people who have not been exposed to them that it may take you some time to wrap your head around them. But I swear I\u2019m not making them up \u2013 in fact you can read all about them in standard economics textbooks. I recommend the chapter The Curse of Machinery in Henry Hazlitt's Economics In One Lesson, and Frederic Bastiat's satirical Candlemaker's Petition to blot out the sun due to its unfair competition with the lighting industry, here modernized for our times.\n\nBut this time is different, you\u2019re thinking. This time, with AI, we have the technology that can replace ALL human labor.\n\nBut, using the principles I described above, think of what it would mean for literally all existing human labor to be replaced by machines.\n\nIt would mean a takeoff rate of economic productivity growth that would be absolutely stratospheric, far beyond any historical precedent. Prices of existing goods and services would drop across the board to virtually zero. Consumer welfare would skyrocket. Consumer spending power would skyrocket. New demand in the economy would explode. Entrepreneurs would create dizzying arrays of new industries, products, and services, and employ as many people and AI as they could as fast as possible to meet all the new demand.\n\nSuppose AI once again replaces that labor? The cycle would repeat, driving consumer welfare, economic growth, and job and wage growth even higher. It would be a straight spiral up to a material utopia that neither Adam Smith nor Karl Marx ever dared dream of.\n\nWe should be so lucky."
