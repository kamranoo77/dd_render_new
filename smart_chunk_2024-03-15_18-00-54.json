In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come [AI apocalypse, or its prevention] will be followed by a new, purified world [AI bans] in which the believers will be rewarded [or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along].\u201d",

    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_6.png 1": "The fear that technology of our own creation will rise up and destroy us is deeply coded into our culture.

    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_6.png 5": "My view is that the idea that AI will decide to literally kill humanity is a profound category error. AI is not a living being that has been primed by billions of years of evolution to participate in the battle for the survival of the fittest, as animals are, and as we are.

    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_17.png 0": "I propose a simple plan: Big AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can \u2013 but not allowed to achieve regulatory capture, not allowed to establish a government-protected cartel that is insulated from market competition due to incorrect claims of AI risk.

    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_17.png 3": "To offset the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI, governments working in partnership with the private sector should vigorously engage in each area of potential risk to use AI to maximize society\u2019s defensive capabilities. This shouldn\u2019t be limited to AI-enabled risks but also more general problems such as malnutrition, disease, and climate. AI can be an incredibly powerful tool for solving problems, and we should embrace it as such.",

For alcohol prohibition, these actors were often literally devout Christians who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society. For AI risk, these actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks \u2013 strap them to a polygraph, they really mean it.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_5.png 1": "Bootleggers are the self-interested opportunists who stand to financially profit by the imposition of new restrictions, regulations, and laws that insulate them from competitors. For alcohol prohibition, these were the literal bootleggers who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned. For AI risk, these are CEOs who stand to make more money if regulatory barriers are erected that form a cartel of government-blessed AI vendors protected from new startup and open source competition \u2013 the software version of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks.",

    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_5.png 3": "The problem with the Bootleggers is that they win. The Baptists are naive ideologues, the Bootleggers are cynical operators, and so the result of reform movements like these is often that the Bootleggers get what they want \u2013 regulatory capture, insulation from competition, the formation of a cartel \u2013 and the Baptists are left wondering where their drive for social improvement went so wrong.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_5.png 4": "We just lived through a stunning example of this \u2013 banking reform after the 2008 global financial crisis. The Baptists told us that we needed new laws and regulations to break up the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again. So Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was marketed as satisfying the Baptists' goal, but in reality was coopted by the Bootleggers \u2013 the big banks. The result is that the same banks that were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d in 2008 are much, much larger now.",

In contrast to this positive view, the public conversation about AI is presently shot through with hysterical fear and paranoia.

What explains this divergence in potential outcomes from near utopia to horrifying dystopia?",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_4.png 1": "Historically, every new technology that matters, from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the Internet, has sparked a moral panic \u2013 a social contagion that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world, or society, or both. The fine folks at Pessimists Archive have documented these technology-driven moral panics over the decades; their history makes the pattern vividly clear. It turns out this present panic is not even the first for AI.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_4.png 2": "Now, it is certainly the case that many new technologies have led to bad outcomes \u2013 often the same technologies that have been otherwise enormously beneficial to our welfare. So it\u2019s not that the mere existence of a moral panic means there is nothing to be concerned about. But a moral panic is by its very nature irrational \u2013 it takes what may be a legitimate concern and inflates it into a level of hysteria that ironically makes it harder to confront actually serious concerns.",
    "/Why AI Will Save the World - Andreessen Horowitz_page_4.png 3": "And wow do we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now. This moral panic is already being used as a motivating force by a variety of actors to demand policy action \u2013 new AI restrictions, regulations, and laws. These actors, who are making extremely dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI \u2013 feeding on and further inflaming moral panic \u2013 all present themselves as selfless champions of the public good.
